# Industrial Robotic Arm Prototype with Blynk Control

This project demonstrates an industrial robotic arm prototype with **6 degrees of freedom (6 DOF)**, controlled remotely through the **Blynk** app using the **ESP8266** microcontroller. The robotic arm allows for flexible movement and control over each joint, simulating various industrial automation tasks.

## Features

- **6 Degrees of Freedom (6 DOF):** Simulates complex movements for realistic task execution.
- **Wireless Control with Blynk:** Provides easy remote control via the Blynk app.
- **Real-Time Control:** Adjust servo angles through the Blynk interface, with instant response.
- **Simple Setup:** Control each servo using sliders in the Blynk app for a straightforward user experience.

## Components Used

- **ESP8266 Module**: For WiFi connectivity and integration with the Blynk app.
- **Servo Motors**: High-torque servos for each joint (4 controlled in code; expand as needed).
- **Power Supply**: Sufficient power supply for servo operation.

## Code Overview

The code uses Blynk's virtual pins to control each servo:

- `V0`, `V1`, `V2`, `V3`: Control the angles of servos `servo1`, `servo2`, `servo3`, and `servo4`.
- `V4`, `V5`, `V6`, `V7`: Display current servo angles on the Blynk app.

### Quick Start

1. **Set up WiFi Credentials**:
   Replace `ssid` and `pass` in the code with your WiFi network name and password.
   
2. **Configure Blynk**:
   - Replace `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID`, `BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME`, and `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN` with your own from the Blynk project.
   
3. **Wiring**:
   - Connect the servos to digital pins `D2`, `D3`, `D5`, and `D6` on the ESP8266.

4. **Upload Code**:
   Upload the code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.

5. **Control via Blynk**:
   Open the Blynk app and set up sliders on virtual pins `V0` to `V3` to control the servos.

## Code Example

```
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "Your_Template_ID"
#define BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME "ROBOT ARM"
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "Your_Auth_Token"

// Include libraries and initialize servos...
```

## Applications

This prototype can be adapted for:
- Pick-and-place operations
- Assembly line tasks
- Remote tasks in hazardous environments

## Future Improvements

- Add collision detection sensors for safe operation.
- Incorporate feedback systems for precise position control.
- Expand the system with AI for autonomous functions.
